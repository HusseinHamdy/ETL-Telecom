# ETL-Telecom

# Overview
ETL project for a telecom company, where I processed multiple files containing critical data on customer movements, applied necessary transformations, and stored the data in a SQL database using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services).

# Key Steps in the ETL Pipeline:

- Extracting data from various files 
- Applying transformations and cleaning the data 
- Loading the structured data into a database 
- Moving processed files to a different folder 

# Tools

- SQL Server 
- SSIS

# SSIS Package
